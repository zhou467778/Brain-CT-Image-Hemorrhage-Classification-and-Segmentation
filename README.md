# Brain-CT-Image-Hemorrhage-Classification-and-Segmentation

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke, which requires fast and precise diagnosis. Nowadays, machine learning models are used widely in fastening and improving the decision-making process by taking input of computed tomography (CT) of the brain. These brain CT images come from patients who were diagnosed with single type of ICH, multiple types of ICH and without any sources of bleeding. After data cleaning, we implemented three image classification models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), pretrained ResNet50 and Descision Tree model on 112,936 datasets using scikit-learn and Tensorflow. The data were split into training data, validation data and testing data with a splitting ratio of 80:10:10. The accuracies of these three models are below 30 percent. We then ran an image segmentation algorithm to predict the area of hemorrhage. The model accuracy reached 98.4 percent by applying U-net convolutional network architecture using matplotlib and TensorFlow. This demonstrates the positive and efficient impact of machine learning techniques on medical image decision making.
